INSTRUCTIONS FOR BACKEND SETUP
==============================

1. Login to your free.nf hosting account (or any PHP hosting).
2. Open the File Manager (htdocs folder).
3. Upload the `index.php` file from this directory.
4. Create a file named `location.txt` in the same directory (make sure it's writable/chmod 777 if needed, though usually 644 is fine on standard hosts).
5. Note down the full URL to your index.php.
   Example: http://your-site.free.nf/index.php

You will need to enter this URL in the Android app.
